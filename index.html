          <h3>Here is a timeline of Alan Rickman's life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>1946</b> - Born in Acton, London</li>
            <li><b>1956</b> - Wins a scholarship to Latymer Upper School, with his first dramatic role in a school production of Shakespeare's <i>Coriolanus</i>, playing the title character's mother</li>
            <li><b>1964</b> - Studies graphic design at Chelsea College of Art and Design, where he meets his future wife Rima Horton</li>
            <li><b>1967</b> - Enrolls in graduate studies at the Royal College of Art, working as a graphic designer for Notting Hill Herald. "Drama school wasn't considered the sensible thing to do at 18," he recalled during an interview in 2011.</li>
            <li><b>1969</b> - Opens a successful graphic design studio, Graphiti, with several friends and runs it for 3 years</li>
            <li><b>1972</b> - Decides to pursue acting professionally, requesting an audition with the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art Graduates after 2 years of studies and supporting himself working as a dresser for senior actors</li>
            <li><b>1974-1985</b> - Performs with several British repertory and experimental theatre groups such as the Court Drama Group and the acclaimed Royal Shakespeare Company, the latter of which he disliked the experience. "It's a factory," he said, "It has to be. It's all about product endlessly churned out--not sufficiently about process. They don't look after the young actors....There ought to be someone who helps them develop."</li>
            <li><b>1985</b> - Plays the male lead, Le Vicompte de Valmont, in the <abbr title="Royal Shakespeare Company">RSC</abbr> production of <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i>, for which he receives a Tony Award nomination and Drama Desk Award nomination when the production moves to Broadway</li>
            <li><b>1988</b> - Makes his film debut as legendary villain Hans Gruber in <i>Die Hard</i>, earning the 46th spot on the American Film Institute's list of the "100 Best Heroes/Villains"</li>
            <li><b>1993</b> - Gets elected to the Council of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, later becoming <abbr title="Royal Academy of Dramatic Art">RADA</abbr>'s Vice-Chairman, its Artistic Advisory and Training Development Board; his desire to help struggling performers leads him to be <a href="http://ipat.org.uk/trustees/a-message-from-the-president/" target="_blank">Honorary President</a> of <abbr title="International Performers' Aid Trust">IPAT</abbr> in later years.</li>
            <li><b>1999</b> - Plays Sir Alexander Dane/Dr. Lazarus in the sci-fi adventure/parody film <i>Galaxy Quest</i>, a role seriously deserving of an Oscar according to this writer</li>
            <li><b>2001-2011</b> - Portrays the iconic role of Severus Snape in the <i>Harry Potter</i> film franchise, earning several award nominations for Best Supporting Actor</li>
            <li><b>2012</b> - Marries longtime partner Rima Horton in a private ceremony in New York City</li>
            <li><b>2015</b> - Tapes a voiceover for <a href="https://youtu.be/HkiMz-e2ZcE" target="_blank"><i>This Tortoise Could Save a Life</i></a>, a short film in aid of the Save the Children and Refugee Council--this was his final job.</li>
